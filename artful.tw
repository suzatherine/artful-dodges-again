Now turn around. You’ll see a camera. Down from there. That’s where I am.

You can’t see me yet, I know. But I am there and I can see you.

Now I did say this was an adventure for my own sort. That’s to say what you might call...children. I don’t like to use that word though. Whenever you say you’re a child, people tell you about all the things you’re not allowed to do. And I don’t like being told I can’t do things.

So while I may be a child (technically speaking that is), I’m also my own man.

Best of both worlds, you might say.

So what are you? And before you answer, this adventure’s for grown ups and children so if you’re all grown ups, choose the youngest ones to be the children. And if you’re all children, the biggest can pretend to be grown-ups for the day. Either way, we want an even split.

Work that out amongst yourselves if you must. And then tell me which one you are.<</timed>>

Pleased to make your acquaintance I’m sure. Jack Dawkins is the name. Though you may know me better as The Artful Dodger.

Now before we move on. There are a
couple of things I wanna say about Mr Charles Dickens and his descriptions of me in what is otherwise a very fine book, Oliver Twist, about my posh mate Olly.

There are some inaccuracies.

Didn’t think I could read, did he?

“Short of his age”. Average for my time, I’ll have you know.

“Bow legs”! Perfectly regular legs as you can see!

And this is real kicker: “little...sharp...ugly eyes”

I ask you! 

Now I don’t wanna get personal but Charlie himself looked like a dustpan ‘n’ brush. Calling another man “ugly” saying that my eyes are “little”. Of course they’re little! I’m little! They’re in proportion!


Alright then. That’s just something I’ve wanted to get off my chest for about two hundred years.

Thank you kindly for the opportunity.

Today, I’mma show you the City of London.

Now some people look at a city like this and they think it’s the dirtiest and most wretched place that they’ve ever seen. That the streets are narrow and muddy and the air is pregnant with filthy odours.

Now I’m not saying that’s not true.
If you’re being all literal but these people: they lack imagination. They don’t have their own inner world. Not like children do.

To me, this place is a playground.

And that’s I’m gonna show you.

Are you ready for the first game?

For this game all you have to do is walk. That’s it. Simple as.

This here’s the Bank of England.
Imagine the riches in there. They wouldn’t let someone like me in though. And they’re right. Because I’d nick stuff. It’s just what I’m like.

It’s the weekend so we can’t go inside any case. Walk round the corner to Bartholomew Lane. Don’t cross the street because we don’t want to worry about cars.

Keep going and don’t worry about your little ones. Not like me to lead them astray or nothing.

Let me know when you get to Lothbury.

You done well so far. Reckon you’ve worked out what the game is by now?

Well if you have, maybe try to play along. Do a silly walk. Start hopping. Or whatever you like. Let them know that you know they’re copying you.

Have some fun with it! Go on. Let’s keep playing until you get to the corner of Tokenhouse Yard.

These grown ups are going to start walking, just walking without a clue what’s going on. What we’re going to do is imitate them. To begin with, better to start imitating the grown ups you came here with: your parent, your sibling or maybe you’re like me and you got a Fagin, I don’t know.

Start with them though. If there are others around though and you want to do a swap with another child, do that. Make sure they agree though.

People don’t always like it when they see someone copying their mum. Trust me on that!

I’ve told the grown ups where to go but all we’re doing is going round the corner onto a street called Bartholomew Lane. Stay on this pavement, don’t cross the road. Wouldn’t want you getting lost. When you get to the end of the street, where it turns onto a street called Lothbury, let me know on here.

Now let’s go!

There you are. After carefully considering my personal, extremely complex scoring system, I can confidently say that the adults scored a grand total of 672 points in that game

But the children are the winners with 3,793 points!

Don’t give up hope, adults, though.
There’s everything to play for in the next round.

Also if anyone does fancy buying a watch, come find me after. Totally kosher, don’t you worry, son.

Are we ready for the next game?

Well let’s not dawdle then. Fix up, look sharp.

C’mon. Let’s go into Tokenhouse Yard.

Keep going along here.

 Until you get to a dead end.

When you’re there, choose one of you to start as grandma.

You know this game, don’t you?

Grandma’s Footsteps. Whoever’s grandma goes over there and stands
facing the wall next to number 11.

Everyone else starts on side of the bollards up the door to the other ‘ere.

You all try to reach grandma and pick her pocket - I mean - tap her on the shoulder. What am I like? Always confusing those two.

If grandma turns around, everyone has to freeze. If grandma sees any movement at all, you’re out.

If you do tap grandma on the shoulder, you win that round and you become grandma.

If you’re standing or walking behind the bollards, you’re not part of the game.

If you see folk what want to join in, just catch them up on the rules or tell them to listen to me.

Play as many round as you fancy and when you’re ready to go, just let me know.

Well played all. I’ve added up the scores and that’s...

Yes, that’s right. It’s 473 points for the adults but the children are still in the lead with...

One million points!

Hurrah!

Don’t worry though, adults, the last game is where the real points are. There’s ooooh 16 million points up for grabs in that one, I reckon.

Let’s go and find out. Through this tunnel. Yeah, that’s the one, toward the Dover Harbour, you know: Barber!

Go all the way through until you get to Telegraph Street.

We’ll play a game in here too.

On Telegraph Street, make sure you’re heading left. Then look
under your feat.

We’re going to play: don’t step on the cracks. Just as far as the bollards there. This street is pretty easy so we can all play it. No points for this. Like a trial run. Off you go and let me know when you’re at the bollards.

You know what a telegraph is, don’t you? It’s some way that I can tell you something through symbols. Don’t matter if it’s flags or needles pointing to letters of the alphabet. Or some other way you have of using symbols. As it happens, the year of the events described by Mr Charles Dickens, unfortunate for some (my dear Nancy) and fortunate for others (that lucky little so-and-so Oliver), that was the same year the first telegraph was invented. 1837. Not in London, as it happens. On the Liverpool-Manchester railway. So they could communicate at a distance. And now look at you. Communicating at a distance all the time. That’s when it all started you might say.

Okay, this time, it’s only the grown ups who have to avoid the cracks. Children, it’s your job to stop them succeeding. So find any way you can to get in their way. Don’t push them over or trip them though. That’s a foul.

Any adult who touches a crack ten points deducted from the adults. And don’t think I can’t see you. I see everything!

There’s Old Dr Butler’s Head to the left. It’s the name of a pub, not his actual ‘ead!

Dr Butler lived before my time even. I’m not sure you’d call him a “doctor” anymore. He had a lot of them “miracle cures”. One of them, the best one, I reckon, could only take place on London Bridge. The patient’d get there and Dr Butler would tell them exactly where to stand. When they were in position, he’d pull a lever and open a trapdoor underneath them and they’d fall straight down into the Thames!

I knew that! Let me just work out those scores...

That’s one crack stepped on by the children so minus 10 for them. An almost flawless performance and a foul committed by the grown ups so they lose 500 points.

Bad day to be grown up, it would seem!

Still plenty to play for though, plenty to play for!

Let’s cross Basinghall Street next.
There’s the Guildhall. Now...if you haven’t been you should take a look around the Guildhall but not now. There was an incident that involved a misunderstanding where I was innocently wanting to borrow an item but my motives were misinterpreted, you know what I mean?

Anyway, I wouldn’t say I’m banned exactly. Just that it’s best I stay away from it!

So take a right here.

Now, adults, I don’t want to be encouraging you to try to leap over those bollards but if any of you could do it... I bet your children would be impressed...

No pressure. I’ll give a moment.

Don’t bother tryin’ to nick that statue. It’s miles too heavy.

Cross Aldermanbury and make your down Love Lane, going either side of the garden here, to Wood Street.

Oranges and lemons,
Say the bells of St Clement’s. You owe me five farthings,
Say the bells of St Martin’s. When will you pay me?
Say the bells of Old Bailey. When I grow rich,
Say the bells of Shoreditch. When will that be?
Say the bells of Stepney.
I do not know,
Says the great bell of Bow.
Here comes a candle to light you to bed, And here comes a chopper to chop off your head! Chip-chop-chip-chop The last one’s head Must come OFF!


Sounds like you got it first time!

Now do you know how to play?

The two players in the middle make an arch by joining their hands and raising them.

Everyone else in the circle holds hands and moves around the circle as we sing the song.

When it gets to “the great bell of Bow”, everyone has to pass through the “arch” one by one as fast as they can. The last player to go through when the song ends so that’s the word “off” is caught and they’re out of the game.
The winner is the last survivor.

Play as many rounds as you want. I can play the song again if you need it. Let me know when you’re done though and I’ll work out the points!

Right then. As you know there were 16 million points up for grabs in that one. So everything to play for.

The grown ups did very well. Getting 3 million points. 
But the children are the victors with 18.5 million points!

Well done all but well done, children, in particular. Taking part’s important and all but winning’s even better. That’s what I say.

I’ve been Jack Dawkins, the Artful Dodger. And if you remember one thing about me, remember this. This town can have its airs and its graces, it can get all clean and safe and expensive. But it’s still my town. And nothing’s gonna change that. Not never.

Oh and if anyone does want one of them watches, come see me. No questions asked innit.
